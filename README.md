## skipsize

My approach to coding this redesign focused on breaking down the problem into manageable React components, handling data efficiently, and ensuring a great user experience across devices.

### 1. Project Setup and Component Structure

* Started with a standard React project setup (likely using Vite, given the initial screenshot, or Create React App).
* **Decomposed the UI into components:**
    * `App.jsx`: Served as the main container. It manages the overall state (loading, errors, selected skip, fetched data) and orchestrates the rendering of other components.
    * `SkipCard.jsx`: A reusable component designed to display the details of a single skip (image, name, price, description) and handle its selection.
    * `Modal.jsx`: A custom component to provide a better, more integrated confirmation message than a native browser `alert()`.
    * `skipService.jsx`: A dedicated file to centralize all API-related logic, keeping the main components clean.

### 2. Data Fetching and Management

* **API Integration (`skipService.jsx`):**
    * Created an `async` function `fetchSkips` to get data from `https://app.wewantwaste.co.uk/api/skips/by-location?postcode=NR32&area=Lowestoft`.
    * Implemented error handling to catch issues during the API call (e.g., network errors, non-OK responses).
    * Crucially, the fetched data was processed before being used. This involved calculating the final price (including VAT) and constructing name and description fields, which made the data directly consumable by the SkipCard components.
* **Loading Data in `App.jsx`:**
    * Used React's `useEffect` hook to call `fetchSkips` once when the `App` component mounts.
    * Managed loading and error states to provide immediate user feedback (e.g., "Loading skip options..." or an error message).

### 3. UI/UX and Interactivity

* **Rendering Skips:** In `App.jsx`, I mapped over the fetched `skips` array to render a `SkipCard` component for each available skip. Each `SkipCard` received its specific `skip` data, a boolean `isSelected` prop (to highlight the chosen skip), and an `onSelect` callback.
* **Handling Selection:**
    * When a user clicked "Select This Skip" on a `SkipCard`, the `handleSelectSkip` function in `App.jsx` was triggered.
    * This function updated the `selectedSkip` state and displayed the custom `Modal` with a confirmation message.
* **Progress Tracker & Header:** Incorporated a visual progress tracker and clear header/subtitle to guide the user through the process and enhance the overall page structure.

### 4. Responsiveness and Styling

* **`App.css`:** All custom styling for the page layout, component appearance, and responsiveness was managed here.
* **Mobile and Desktop Adaptability:** Utilized modern CSS techniques (e.g., Flexbox/Grid for the skip card layout) along with media queries within `App.css` to ensure the page renders correctly and provides a good user experience on both small (mobile) and large (desktop) screens. The goal was to make the layout fluid and adaptable.
